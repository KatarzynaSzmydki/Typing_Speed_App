{"0":{"title":"Learning is sweet","body":"As a first grade Reading Recovery teacher, I had to do assessments at the beginning of the school year to determine which students qualified for the program. Part of the assessment was having them read a sheet with randomly ordered upper and lowercase letters. One of the students I was testing came to a lowercase m. He looked and looked at it. Finally, he turned to me and said, I have seen that letter on M&Ms, but I dont know what its called."},
"1":{"title":"Fueling the fire","body":"My three-year-old daughter was trying to roast a marshmallow for the first time. Her first and second attempts ended in flames. Both times, I took the scorched marshmallow off of the roasting stick and threw it into the fire. The third time, I helped her a lot more and, together, we achieved a perfectly toasty golden brown. Once it was cool, I handed her the marshmallow which she promptly threw into the fire. No one had told her she was supposed to eat it."},
"2":{"title":"The long and the short of it","body":"I am an 84-year-old gentleman who stands 54 tall from the basketball-crazy state of Indiana. Recently, my wife and I were having dinner at a local restaurant. Our waiter was a young man, around 68. Naturally, I asked him if he played basketball. He looked down at me, replied, Yes, I do, and then asked me if I played miniature golf."},
"3":{"title":"The wild bunch","body":"While at a motel in North Dakota, I went to breakfast and sat by a gentleman who was on the phone. I overheard him say that he had lost time yesterday because his passengers got cranky so he stopped at a truck stop and hosed them down with cold water. Then I noticed a school bus in front of the motel that hadnt been there the day before. When the gentleman ended his call, I asked him if that was his bus. No, he replied. Im in the back with a semi load of pigs."}}
